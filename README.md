# Anita-Modiste
This is a directory that is used to collaborate and earn money, Anam is a student who needs my services to work on this website.
This is a repo that I created to store and document what I have done and created with Anam, a student from Blitar. 
As I was studying and wanted to create a web design using CSS, I was recruited by him to create the appearance of the design as well as fix the semantics in the HTML code he created.
He paid me around Rp. 50,000 per project that I worked on, but actually this wasn't the only thing I did, I also made flowcharts and created the program flow with Anam.
